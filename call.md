# Call for papers

Abstracts are invited for a 30-minute talk or a poster.

Papers can be in any area of formal linguistics (including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) and within any theoretical framework. We welcome papers that address experimental, diachronic, sociolinguistic, or applied topics from a formal perspective, and we are also interested in papers that address the responsibilities of formal linguistic research with respect to the concerns and needs of Indigenous communities.

Abstracts must conform to the following requirements:

+ Author name(s) should not appear in the abstract or file name
+ A4 (21 x 29.7 cm) or letter size (8.5 x 11in) paper
+ 2.54cm / 1in margins
+ Times New Roman font (or equivalent)
+ 12pt font size
+ 2 pages including data and references (optional)â€”Please interleave data into the abstract. *Do not gather the examples at the end of the abstract.*

Authors may submit a maximum of (1) one singly-authored abstract and one jointly-authored abstract, or (2) two jointly-authored abstracts.

Submit your abstract via [EasyAbs](https://easyabs.linguistlist.org/conference/WSCLA28/).
